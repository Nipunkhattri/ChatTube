Pooling layers combine the values of adjacent pixels in a feature map, reducing the size of the feature map and the number of parameters in the model. This helps to reduce overfitting and makes the model more efficient to train. There are two main types of pooling: max pooling and average pooling. Max pooling takes the maximum value from a window of pixels, while average pooling takes the average value. Max pooling is more commonly used in CNNs because it is more effective at capturing the most important features in the data.\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is cnn in detail ?\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"assistant: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process data that has a grid-like structure, such as images.
